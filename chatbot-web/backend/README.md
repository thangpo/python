# Backend Chatbot Documentation

## Overview
This project implements a chatbot using Python, which can predict user intents and generate appropriate responses. The chatbot logic is encapsulated in the `chatbot.py` file, while the backend dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Files

### chatbot.py
This file contains the core logic of the chatbot, including:
- **Intent Prediction**: Uses a machine learning model to predict user intents based on input text.
- **Response Generation**: Returns a random response from a predefined set of responses based on the predicted intent.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes user input for better prediction accuracy.
- **Chatbot Execution**: Contains the main loop to interact with users.

### requirements.txt
This file lists the necessary Python libraries required to run the chatbot. Ensure to install these dependencies before running the application.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chatbot-web/backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   Then install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Chatbot**
   Execute the chatbot by running:
   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

4. **Interacting with the Chatbot**
   Once the chatbot is running, you can interact with it through the command line. Type your messages and receive responses until you type 'quit', 'exit', or 'tho√°t' to end the session.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `data/intents.json` file is correctly populated with intents for the chatbot to function properly.
- For further customization, you can modify the intents and responses in the `chatbot.py` file.
